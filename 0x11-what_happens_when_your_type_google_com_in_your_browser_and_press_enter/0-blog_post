# Network Infrastructure Overview

This repository provides an overview of fundamental components of network infrastructure.

## Domain Name System (DNS)

DNS serves as a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for identifying internet resources, associating domain names with numerical IP addresses. Operated through a query/response protocol, it facilitates efficient data retrieval.

## Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)

TCP, a connection-oriented protocol, establishes reliable data transmission channels, while IP, at the network layer, facilitates packet routing across networks. TCP/IP constitutes the fundamental framework of internet communication.

## Firewall

A firewall is a network security mechanism that regulates inbound and outbound traffic based on predetermined rules. By segregating trusted and untrusted networks, it fortifies network integrity and safeguards against unauthorized access.

## Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure/Secure Sockets Layer (HTTPS/SSL)

HTTPS, an extension of HTTP, ensures secure data transmission over networks by employing SSL encryption. SSL, a cryptographic protocol, maintains data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, thus enhancing communication security.

## Load Balancer

A load balancer functions as a reverse proxy, evenly distributing network and application traffic across multiple servers. By optimizing resource allocation and mitigating server overload, it enhances system performance and reliability.

## Web Server

A web server comprises software and hardware components that process HTTP/HTTPS requests and deliver web content. Acting upon client requests, it provides requested resources or generates error responses, thereby facilitating seamless web communication.

## Application Server

An application server hosts and manages software applications, providing a runtime environment for their execution. Equipped with comprehensive service layers, it supports dynamic web page generation and implements advanced functionalities such as clustering and load balancing.

## Database

A database constitutes an organized repository of electronically stored data, managed by a Database Management System (DBMS). DBMS software facilitates data capture, storage, retrieval, and analysis, thus enabling efficient data management and utilization.

## URL Processing

When entering a URL such as https://www.google.com:
- The browser translates the URL into a structured request message containing protocol, hostname, and optional port/path components.
- This request undergoes processing through intermediary systems like load balancers and firewalls before reaching the designated server.
- Upon receiving the request, the server executes appropriate actions, serving requested content or generating error responses as necessary.
- Finally, the browser interprets and presents the received content to the user in accordance with the HTTP response.
